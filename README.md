# Nustana-Android

## Introduction
Nustana-Android is a mobile application based around my second semester project "NUSTANA" . The previous was a desktop Java application,
using backendless (BaaS), while this project is an android application using firebase. The application is basically a Food Ordering App,
with a robust design to handle and manipulate large user data. The entire project has been developed by me alone and can serve as a good 
learning resource or a productive working app service for a restaurant with a few tweaks. It demonstrates the use of fragments,
user preferences , offline working ,offline storage and data restrictions.

 ## Contribution
 I would be happy to recieve any recommendation and would accept any critisim regarding the app. It is my first major app, and is prone
 to random crash which might have skipped my eye during the testing. I would also be happy to recieve any contribution to this
 project. Also do inform me of any issue you may find. 
 
 
 ## Note
 The app has been filled with dummy data to demostrate its functionality, the data is in no case authentic and the app is not backed by any real
 restaurant, To eat from a real restaurant, download a real app.
